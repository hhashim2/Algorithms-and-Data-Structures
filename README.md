# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
**Course taught by Professor Kinga Lipskoch at Jacobs University Bremen during Spring 2019**

The course material is referred from Introduction to Algorithms by Charles E. Leiserson which is by far one of the best books to learn algorithms.
An online course at the MIT OCW is an identical run of this course, namely SMA 5503 Fall 2005 which has video lectures from Professor Eric Demaine and Professor Charles Leiserson himself.
